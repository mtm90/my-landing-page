        My name is Mattia Totonchi Moghaddam. <br />
        I'm an Italian/Iranian Tech enthusiast and i just recently got involved
        in this field of work. I have always been interested in new technologies
        (<span>blockchain</span> and <span>AI</span> to name a few) and since i
        couldn't find a job in my field of study (i have a Bachelors Degree in{" "}
        <span>Business Economics</span>) i was forced to make a complete career
        switch. <br />I find this environment particularly exciting and that's
        one of the reason i decided to acquire the skills to find a position as
        a <span>front-end developer.</span> <br />
        I'm currently refining my ability with <span>HTML</span>,{" "}
        <span>CSS</span> and <span>Javascript</span> with a specialization in{" "}
        <span>React</span>. <br />
        I don't have any work experience in this field yet but i'm very eager to
        start working and keep improving myself. In the last few weeks i have
        been attending an online intensive course in which i've acquired all of
        my skills. <br /> <br />
        Here is my CV if you want more info about me. <br /> <br />
